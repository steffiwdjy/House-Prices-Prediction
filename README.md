# House Prices Prediction

### Introduction
When asked to describe their dream home, potential homebuyers might not mention ceiling heights, basements, or proximity to public transportation. However, the price is likely a significant factor in their considerations.

This project aims to predict house prices based on selected features using the House Prices dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the price of a house based on its characteristics.

Source Dataset: [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

### Attributes Used for Analysis
- SalePrice: The sale price of the house.
- OverallQual: Overall material and finish quality.
- GrLivArea: Above ground living area.
- GarageCars: Car capacity in the garage.
- TotalBsmtSF: Total basement area.
- X1stFlrSF: First-floor area.
- FullBath: Number of full bathrooms.
- YearBuilt: Year the house was built.
- OverallCond: Overall condition of the house.
- Utilities: Type of utilities available.
- Neighborhood: Location of the neighborhood.
- ExterQual: Exterior quality.
- ExterCond: Exterior condition.
- Street: Type of street access to the property.
- LotShape: Shape of the lot.

### Data Preparation
The dataset requires preprocessing to handle missing values, categorical variables, and outliers. The steps include:
1. Handling Missing Values: Imputing or removing missing data to ensure completeness.
2. Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
3. Feature Scaling: Normalizing or standardizing numerical features to bring them onto a similar scale.
4. Outlier Detection: Identifying and handling outliers that may skew the model.

### Data Exploration
Data exploration involves understanding the distribution and relationships between features. Key steps include:
1. Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the datasetâ€™s distribution.
2. Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between features using correlation matrices and scatter plots.
3. Visualization: Using plots to visualize the distribution of features and their relationships with the target variable (SalePrice).

### Data Analysis
In-depth data analysis is performed to uncover patterns and insights. This includes:
1. Feature Importance: Identifying which features are most predictive of house prices.
2. Statistical Testing: Conducting hypothesis tests to validate assumptions and findings.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and interpreting the data to draw meaningful conclusions.

### Predictive Modeling
Building and evaluating predictive models to estimate house prices:
1. Model Selection: Choosing appropriate regression models.
2. Model Training: Training models on the training dataset.
3. Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters to improve performance.

### Results Analysis
Analyzing the results to understand model performance and insights:
1. Model Performance: Comparing different models based on RMSE and other relevant metrics.
2. Feature Impact: Assessing the impact of each feature on the predicted house prices.

### Conclusion
Key Factors Influencing House Prices:
1. Overall Quality: The overall material and finish quality of the house.
2. Exterior Quality: The quality of the house's exterior materials and finishes.
3. Neighborhood: The location of the house significantly affects its sale price, with better neighborhoods generally commanding higher prices.
4. Year Built: Newer houses tend to have higher sale prices due to better condition and modern features.

### Insights
- Quality Matters: Houses with higher overall and exterior quality tend to sell for more.
- Location, Location, Location: The neighborhood is a critical determinant of house prices.
- Modernity Pays Off: Newer houses have a premium due to their condition and contemporary amenities.

### Actionable Insights
- Investment in Quality
- Strategic Location
- Renovation and Upgrades
